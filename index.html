<h1> Finally, Victoria Asido Bassey is a developer</h1>
<h2> I am a student, a fashion designer and an entrepreneur</h2>
<h3> I am a Nigerian who loves learning languages and currently undergoing a French and Spanish Tutorial</h3>
<h4> Well, what better way to be utmostly unique, surely, when near perfection sets in as a fashion freak, a polyglot and a web programmer?</h4>
<h5> In all, Congratulations to me in advance because my journey has only began. And hopefully, the sky is just my starting point.</h5>
<h6> Adi√≥s, amigos </h6>
